# Geographical_Plotting

In this project, I use plotly and pandas in Python to create two Choropleth Maps from two simple datasets. 
The first map I create is a Choropleth Map that visualizes the amount of power consumption from around the 
world in 2014. The map shows that the United States and China are the power consumption leaders of the world. 
The second map I create is Choropleth Map that visualizes the population of eligible voters from each state in
the United States.
